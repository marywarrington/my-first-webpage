  <h1>Sleeping, Eating, Squirrels</h1>

  <p>My life may be simple to those that observe me, but it is one of divine awesomeness. Sleeping is the finest form of meditating one can partake in. Eating is the <em>best</em> form of sustinance, and is provided gracefully for me and I need not work for it.</p>

  <p>Squirrels are my <em>passion</em>. They think they have it all, but I get to go be warm and cozy when I'm not chasing them. The squirrels in my area all know me. <strong>They fear me</strong>.</p>

  <p>I love to go the park. At the park I can chase squirrels! And eat poop! And RUN! And roll in the mud! All the best things (except sleeping). I get <em>really</em> annoying if I don't get to go to the park, which means I get to go a LOT.</p>
