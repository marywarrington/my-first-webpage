  <h1>Sleeping, Eating, Squirrels</h1>

  <p>My life may be simple to those that observe me, but it is one of divine awesomeness. Sleeping is the finest form of meditating one can partake in. Eating is the best form of sustinance, and is provided gracefully for me and I need not work for it.</p>

  <p>Squirrels are my passion. They think they have it all, but I get to go be warm and cozy when I'm not chasing them. The squirrels in my area all know me. They fear me.</p>

  <p>I love to go the park. At the park I can chase squirrels! And eat poop! And RUN! And roll in the mud! All the best things (except sleeping). I get really annoying if I don't get to go to the park, which means I get to go a LOT.</p>
